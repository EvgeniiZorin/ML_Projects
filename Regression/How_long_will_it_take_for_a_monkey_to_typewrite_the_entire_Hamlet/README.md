# How_long_will_it_take_for_a_monkey_to_typewrite_the_entire_Hamlet

You have probably heard **the Infinite Monkey theorem**, which states the following:

> "A monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare"

It is always said that this will happen in an infinitely large amount of time, but have you ever wandered <u>just how long exactly</u> will it take to achieve this? 

This exact question motivated me to ~waste hours of my time~ do my own research. 

Please open `Shakespeare_monkeys.ipynb` and check out my findings :)
